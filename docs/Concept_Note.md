## 1. Project Title

**AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA) for DPWH Procurement & Infrastructure Contract Management**

---

## 2. Proponent

**3NETI Research & Development OPC**  
In partnership with affiliated technology and AI infrastructure providers.

A Philippine-owned technology company specializing in:
- Artificial intelligence & computer vision
- Procurement analytics
- Document intelligence
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Compliance automation

## 3. Executive Summary

This concept note proposes an **AI-powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)** as an Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) for the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

The IVCA will act as a **neutral, third-party verifier**—similar to SGS's globally accepted model for inspection and verification—ensuring fairness, transparency, accuracy, and cost-reasonableness in all stages of DPWH procurement and contract execution.

The project **requires no funding from DPWH or the national government**.  
Instead, revenues are generated through contractor-funded verification fees, following a transparent, regulated, Swiss-Challenge-compliant concession model.

The system uses advanced AI to strengthen DPWH's capacity to detect:
- Collusion or coordinated bidding
- Supplier identity manipulation
- Bid tailoring
- Overpricing and unreasonable cost assumptions
- Contract variation risks
- Timeline slippage and performance issues
- "Ghost accomplishments" or unverifiable milestones

The IVCA supports DPWH's mandate of ensuring cost-effective, timely, and corruption-resistant infrastructure delivery.

## 4. Background and Problem Statement

DPWH manages thousands of infrastructure projects annually, involving:
- Complex bid documents
- Highly technical construction requirements
- Multiple bidders per project
- A high volume of contracts to review and monitor

Despite strong processes and dedicated personnel, these challenges persist nationwide:

### 4.1 Procurement Challenges
- Bid documents may contain tailored provisions or ambiguous requirements.
- Manual evaluation is time-intensive and prone to human error.
- Detecting collusion or coordinated bids remains difficult with manual review.
- Cost reasonableness assessment varies across regions and project types.

### 4.2 Contract Management Challenges
- Monitoring timelines and progress across thousands of projects is difficult.
- Validation of accomplishment reports is often manual and retrospective.
- Variation orders and slippages may go undetected until too late.

### 4.3 Integrity Challenges
- Overpricing risks due to outdated or manipulated cost assumptions
- Difficulty ensuring identity validation of contractors or beneficial owners
- Insufficient tools for auditing tender submissions

AI offers a scalable, objective, and repeatable solution.

## 5. Project Objectives

### Primary Objective

To establish an AI-powered third-party verification system that enhances fairness, transparency, and efficiency across DPWH's procurement and project implementation lifecycle.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Improve bid document quality** by ensuring fair, complete, and cost-reasonable specifications.
2. **Detect collusion**, similarities, and anomalous patterns in tender submissions.
3. **Verify bidder identities** and beneficial ownership using AI + compliance intelligence.
4. **Ensure cost reasonableness** based on DPWH historical data, market rates, and AI-driven projections.
5. **Accelerate bid evaluation cycles** through automated structure validation.
6. **Generate contract Gantt charts** automatically from submitted documentation.
7. **Monitor execution** and validate milestone-based payment requests using AI vision.
8. **Provide DPWH, COA, and NEDA** with detailed, auditable, immutable analytics.

## 6. Scope of the Project

### 6.1 Bid Document Creation Review

AI will automatically:
- Check for discriminatory or tailored provisions
- Detect inconsistent or missing clauses
- Validate cost structures against historical benchmarks
- Flag unusually restrictive technical specifications

### 6.2 Bid Tender Evaluation

AI & compliance verification systems will:
- Validate legal, technical, and financial compliance
- Detect similarities across bidders (collusion clues)
- Identify unrealistic cost estimates or schedules
- Analyze unit pricing vs. industry trends
- Generate TWG-ready evaluation analytics

### 6.3 Contract Analysis

Automatically:
- Convert contract text into structured milestones
- Generate Gantt charts
- Identify risk zones
- Flag inconsistencies between TOR, bid, and signed contract

### 6.4 Construction Progress Monitoring

Via upload or mobile app:
- Validate geotagged images/videos
- Detect percentage completion using AI vision
- Flag slippage
- Compare with contracted timelines
- Validate payment requests

### 6.5 Compliance & Audit Support

Provide automated reports:
- For COA
- For NEDA ICC
- For DPWH internal audit
- For PPP Center compliance

---

## 7. Proposed PPP Model (Unsolicited Proposal)

### PPP Type

**Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)** variant or **Build-Operate-Own (BOO)** concession for a digital system.

### Cost to Government

**₱0.00** — Government pays nothing.  
No subsidy, no guarantee, no budgetary allocation.

### Revenue Model (Contractor-Funded)

Similar to SGS or Bureau Veritas:
- Bidders pay a small evaluation fee
- Winning contractors pay a verification fee before NTP
- Optional fees for enhanced monitoring services

This aligns cost recovery with private-sector beneficiaries.

### Concession Period

10–15 years, renewable.

### Regulatory Framework

Compliant with:
- RA 6957 & RA 7718 (BOT Law)
- PPP Center guidelines
- COA Circulars on Third-Party Verification
- DPWH Procurement Manual + RA 9184 principles

### Swiss Challenge

Project will undergo the **mandatory Swiss Challenge**  
— the proponent holds the right to match competing proposals.

## 8. Technology Stack and Capabilities

### AI Capabilities
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for document intelligence
- Computer vision for construction milestone validation
- Bidder behavior anomaly detection
- Generative AI for summarizing complex datasets
- Predictive risk modeling for slippage and variation orders

### Security
- National government–grade encryption
- Zero-trust architecture
- Full compliance with Data Privacy Act

### Interoperability
- Integratable with DPWH systems
- Optional APIs for COA and NEDA

## 9. Expected Benefits to DPWH

### 9.1 Enhanced Transparency

Objective, auditable verification across all procurement steps.

### 9.2 Faster Procurement

Automated validation shortens evaluation time significantly.

### 9.3 Cleaner Projects

Early detection of inflated costs, collusion, or unrealistic timelines.

### 9.4 Improved Contract Performance

AI flags slippage early and monitors progress automatically.

### 9.5 Public Trust Gains

Being the first in ASEAN to deploy a national AI procurement auditor.

### 9.6 Cost Savings for Government

Better validation → fewer variation orders → fewer overruns.

**Subject:** Submission of Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Proposal for an AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)

---

Honorable Secretary [Last Name]:

We respectfully submit for the consideration of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) our Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Proposal for the design, financing, development, operation, and maintenance of an **AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)**—a nationwide digital integrity and monitoring system envisioned to support DPWH's procurement and infrastructure project governance.

This proposed IVCA platform is designed to:

1. **Strengthen procurement integrity** by detecting collusion, bid tailoring, inflated cost assumptions, and irregularities;
2. **Accelerate bid evaluation processes** through AI-assisted technical and financial compliance analysis;
3. **Improve contract implementation monitoring**, including AI-generated Gantt charts, slippage detection, and automated milestone validation;
4. **Provide audit-grade digital evidence** for DPWH, COA, and oversight bodies; and
5. **Enhance public trust and transparency** in national infrastructure programs.

The Project is offered as a **zero-cost-to-government initiative**, consistent with the requirements of Republic Act No. 7718 (Amended BOT Law). Under this model, all verification and monitoring services are funded entirely by private contractors, similar to global third-party inspection models such as SGS. The Government incurs no financial obligations, guarantees, or subsidies.

Enclosed with this submission are the following documents:

1. Concept Note
2. Executive Brief
3. Detailed Feasibility Study Outline
4. Legal Framework under RA 7718 and RA 9184
5. Swiss Challenge Timeline
6. Draft Concession Agreement
7. Fee Schedule for Contractor-Funded Verification Services
8. NEDA ICC Issue Paper (for Stage 1 & 2 Consideration)
9. One-Page Briefer

We respectfully request that the Department:

1. **Receive and evaluate** this Unsolicited Proposal in accordance with RA 7718 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations;
2. **Conduct the initial technical, financial, and legal assessment**; and
3. **If found meritorious, grant Original Proponent Status (OPS)** to allow the Project to proceed to detailed negotiations, feasibility validation, and eventual processing under the Swiss Challenge mechanism.

We express our full commitment to work closely with the DPWH's Technical Working Group, PPP Office, and relevant bureaus to ensure that the IVCA aligns with the Department's standards, workflows, and long-term digital modernization strategy.

We would be honored to present the Project in greater detail at your convenience.

Thank you, Honorable Secretary, for your leadership in strengthening transparency, innovation, and accountability in the nation's infrastructure development. We stand ready to support DPWH in this important endeavor.

Respectfully yours,

---

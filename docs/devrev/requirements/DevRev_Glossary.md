# **C**

### **Certificate of Completion (Milestone)**  
A DPWH document confirming a milestone has been completed. DevRev generates digital versions with DPWH seals, QR verification, and cryptographic hashes.

### **Change Order (CO)**  
A modification to a construction contract. DevRev must handle changes to BOQ and milestones when COs occur.

### **Computation Engine**  
The DevRev subsystem that calculates project progress, EVM, variance, and run-rate predictions.

### **Contract Amount**  
The total cost of the awarded construction project. Used in performance and EVM computations.

### **Cryptographic Hash**  
A unique irreversible value generated from a document, used to verify integrity (e.g., SHA-256 hash on certificates).

---

# **D**

### **Dashboard**  
A visual interface for displaying RAG status, progress, delays, anomalies, and other analytics.

### **Data Warehouse (DW)**  
A specialized database optimized for analytics. DevRev uses a star-schema DW to store facts and dimensions.

### **Deviation**  
A metric showing how far project performance differs from planned values.

### **DPWH.Track (Tracking AI)**  
The capstone-built system collecting field data: attendance, materials, equipment logs, and work performance.

---

# **E**

### **Earned Value (EV)**  
The value of work performed, used in EVM.

### **Earned Value Management (EVM)**  
A standardized methodology for measuring project performance via PV, EV, AC, and variance formulas.

### **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**  
The process of moving data from DPWH.Track → DevRev → DW.

### **Exception**  
A flagged issue generated by the Rules Engine (e.g., withdrawal without receiving).

---

# **F**

### **Field Data**  
Data captured on-site: time-in/out, materials, equipment, work reports, etc.

### **File Store / Object Storage**  
Repository where DevRev stores images, PDFs, and evidence files.

---

# **G**

### **Gantt Chart**  
A project scheduling visualization sometimes exported from DevRev.

### **GPS Tagging**  
Optional metadata from DPWH.Track that validates on-site locations.

---

# **H**

### **Hash (Document Hash)**  
A cryptographic signature of a PDF or document used to verify authenticity.

### **Health Monitoring**  
System status and service checks to ensure DevRev uptime.

---

# **I**

### **Idempotency**  
A property ensuring repeated operations (e.g., PCMA push) produce consistent results.

### **Ingestion Layer**  
Subsystem responsible for accepting and validating data from DPWH.Track.

### **Integration Adapter**  
Custom DevRev component that communicates with PCMA.

---

# **J**

### **Job Scheduler**  
Controls nightly computations, ETL, and automated tasks.

---

# **K**

### **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**  
A measurable value indicating project or system performance (e.g., % delay, completion rate).

---

# **L**

### **Lag / Slippage**  
Difference between planned and actual progress or time.

### **Logical Architecture**  
Layered design describing DevRev’s core subsystems.

---

# **M**

### **Milestone**  
A contract-defined project checkpoint tied to schedule or BOQ performance.

### **Monitoring Report**  
Generated status overview including RAG, variance, and anomalies.

---

# **N**

### **Normalization**  
Process of organizing ingested field data to ensure consistency.

---

# **O**

### **Operational Database (OLTP DB)**  
Primary database optimized for ingestion and transactional queries.

### **Oversight Bodies**  
Auditors, COA, and monitoring units reviewing DevRev outputs.

---

# **P**

### **PCMA (Project & Contract Management Application)**  
The existing DPWH system containing contract baselines, BOQ, and project master data.

### **Percentage Completion**  
Progress measurement computed through DevRev from field data and BOQ.

### **Planned Value (PV)**  
The expected value of work planned to be completed by a certain date.

### **Portfolio View**  
Overview of all projects by region, district, contractor, etc.

---

# **Q**

### **QR Verification**  
A mechanism allowing users to verify certificate authenticity by scanning a QR code.

### **Quantity Take-Off (QTO)**  
Measurement or calculation of quantities required to complete a project.

---

# **R**

### **RAG Status (Red–Amber–Green)**  
Traffic-light system indicating project health:
- **Red**: Delayed or high risk  
- **Amber**: Moderate risk or slight delay  
- **Green**: On track  

### **Reconciliation**  
Matching field data with contract baselines and PCMA values.

### **Rules Engine**  
Subsystem detecting anomalies, inconsistencies, and risks.

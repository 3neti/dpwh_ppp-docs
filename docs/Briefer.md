**AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)**  
**Unsolicited PPP Proposal for DPWH**

---

## What is the Project?

The **AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)** is a nationwide, zero-cost-to-government digital infrastructure system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to strengthen the integrity, speed, and accuracy of DPWH procurement and construction contract monitoring.

It functions as a third-party verification body—similar to global models like SGS—that ensures fairness, cost reasonableness, non-collusion, and proper implementation of projects funded through public infrastructure budgets.

The system is proposed through an Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) under RA 7718, fully funded and operated by the private proponent.

## Why DPWH Needs the IVCA

DPWH faces systemic challenges:
- Heavy volume of procurement documents
- Difficulty detecting collusion or bid tailoring
- Time-consuming bid evaluations
- Cost overruns and variation orders
- Slippage and unverified accomplishments
- Manual project monitoring across thousands of sites

AI provides consistent, fast, and objective verification to support TWGs, BACs, PMOs, and COA auditors.

## What the IVCA Does

### 1. Bid Document Review

Checks TORs, BOQs, and technical specs for fairness, completeness, and cost reasonableness.

### 2. AI Tender Evaluation

Verifies eligibility, analyzes technical and financial compliance, detects anomalies, and provides TWG-ready analytics.

### 3. Contract Analysis

Automatically generates Gantt charts, milestones, and risk assessments.

### 4. Construction Monitoring

Uses AI computer vision to verify progress photos/videos, detect slippage, and validate milestone-based payment requests.

### 5. Audit Support

Provides COA-ready audit logs and forensic-level documentation.

## How the PPP Works

- **Zero cost to DPWH / Government**
- **Contractor-funded fee structure** (the SGS model):
  - Bid Evaluation Fee per bidder
  - Winner Verification Fee
  - Optional monitoring subscription
- **10–15 year Concession Period**
- **DPWH retains full control** over procurement decisions
- **The Proponent** builds, finances, operates, and maintains the system

---

## Legal Basis

The project fully complies with:
- **RA 7718** (BOT Law) – unsolicited proposal with new technology
- **RA 9184** (Procurement Law) – DPWH retains decision-making authority
- **COA Circulars** – digital evidence and third-party verification allowed
- **Data Privacy Act** – privacy-by-design
- **DICT cybersecurity standards**

## Key Benefits to DPWH

- Faster bid evaluation (hours vs. weeks)
- Improved cost integrity and fewer overpriced bids
- Early detection of collusion, anomalies, and fraud
- Reduced risk of variation orders and delays
- More accurate payment validation
- Audit-grade documentation for COA and NEDA
- Higher public trust in infrastructure projects

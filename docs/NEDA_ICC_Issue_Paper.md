## 1. Project Title

AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA) for DPWH Procurement and Infrastructure Projects

---

## 2. Implementing Agency

**Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH)**  
— in coordination with the PPP Center of the Philippines

---

## 3. Proponent

**3NETI Research & Development OPC**  
A Philippine-based AI, compliance, and infrastructure analytics company.

---

## 4. Project Description

The IVCA is a nationwide AI-enabled verification and compliance auditing system designed to:
- Strengthen procurement integrity
- Improve cost reasonableness in DPWH bidding
- Enhance contract implementation monitoring
- Provide audit-grade digital trails for COA and oversight agencies
- Detect slippage, anomalies, and collusive behavior
- Accelerate bid evaluation processes

The IVCA will operate as a third-party, SGS-style independent verification body, built and funded under an Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with zero cost to the government.

**Critical Note:** IVCA is not a party to construction contracts between DPWH and contractors. All contractual obligations, enforcement, and decision-making authority remain exclusively with DPWH and contractors. IVCA provides verification services and data only.

## 5. Rationale and Problem Statement

DPWH manages a large and complex portfolio of infrastructure projects nationwide. Key challenges include:

### 5.1 Procurement Integrity Issues
- Bid tailoring
- Inflated cost assumptions
- Identity manipulation
- Inconsistent document quality
- Collusion among bidders

### 5.2 Capacity Limitations
- Thousands of pages requiring technical/financial review
- Increasing volume of procurement activities
- Manual validation of BOQs, timelines, and technical specs

### 5.3 Contract Monitoring Gaps
- Slippage detection occurs late
- Difficulty validating milestone accomplishments
- High cost of monitoring geographically dispersed projects
- Risk of "ghost accomplishments" and unverifiable progress

### 5.4 COA Auditing Constraints
- Manual document trails slow down audit cycles
- Limited forensic tools to identify anomalies

The IVCA directly addresses these issues.

## 6. Project Objectives

1. Improve fairness, transparency, and predictability of DPWH procurement.
2. Provide AI-assisted evaluation for technical and financial submissions.
3. Detect collusive and anomalous bidding patterns.
4. Ensure cost reasonableness through AI and historical data analysis.
5. Automate Gantt chart generation and monitoring for awarded projects.
6. Validate milestone-based payment accomplishments through AI computer vision.
7. Provide COA with high-fidelity audit trails and digital evidence.

---

## 7. Project Scope

### 7.1 Bid Document Creation Review

AI ensures bid documents are fair, transparent, and cost-aligned.

### 7.2 Bid Tender Evaluation

AI validates all bids, ensuring compliance and detecting anomalies.

### 7.3 Contract Validation and Risk Analysis

Contract monitoring schedules and cost structures are automatically analyzed.

### 7.4 Construction Monitoring

AI verifies geotagged photos/videos, detects completion percentages, and flags slippage. Verification data is provided to DPWH/COA for decision-making.

### 7.5 Reporting and Audit Support

Automated, auditable logs for DPWH, NEDA, COA, and PPP Center.

**Important:** All services are verification and advisory only. IVCA does not approve payments, enforce contracts, or make binding decisions. All such authority remains with DPWH and relevant government agencies.

## 10. Economic and Social Benefits

### 10.1 Governance and Integrity
- Strong anti-corruption tool
- Consistent, unbiased evaluation across regions
- Reduction in anomalous bids and inflated costs

### 10.2 Efficiency
- Faster bid evaluation
- Streamlined contract monitoring
- Fewer variations and disputes

### 10.3 Fiscal Discipline
- Better project delivery → fewer cost overruns
- AI-based forecasts allow early intervention
- Improved COA compliance

### 10.4 Public Trust
- Transparent, data-driven government processes
- Globally pioneering use of AI for infrastructure integrity

---

## 11. Risk Assessment

### 11.1 Technical Risks

Minimal — AI systems are modular and cloud/hybrid-ready.

### 11.2 Financial Risks

Borne entirely by the private sector.

### 11.3 Operational Risks

Addressed through:
- SLA-backed uptime requirements
- Strong cybersecurity protocols
- Redundancy and disaster recovery

### 11.4 Regulatory Risks

Low — full alignment with RA 9184, RA 7718, and COA rules.

### 11.5 Data Privacy Risks

Mitigated via:
- DPA-compliant architecture
- Encryption
- Strict access controls

---

## 12. Legal and Regulatory Compliance

The project is compliant with:
- RA 7718 — allows unsolicited PPPs for new technologies
- RA 9184 — DPWH retains all procurement decision authority
- COA Circulars — digital evidence and third-party verification allowed
- Data Privacy Act (RA 10173) — privacy-by-design
- PPP Center Guidelines — OPS and Swiss Challenge ready

---

## 13. Institutional Arrangements

DPWH will form a Project Management Office (PMO) responsible for:
- Oversight and performance monitoring
- Validation of outputs
- Coordination with PPP Center, COA, NEDA
- Enforcement of standards and compliance

The Proponent will manage:
- System operation
- AI model updates
- Support hotline
- Capacity building
- Continuous innovation

---

## 14. Recommendation

Based on the projected benefits, alignment with national priorities, and zero fiscal exposure, the project is:

**Recommended for Endorsement to NEDA ICC**

for Stage 1 (TB) and Stage 2 (CabCom) approval.

The IVCA aligns with:
- Build Better More
- Anti-corruption modernizations
- Digital transformation
- Efficient infrastructure spending
- Improved public sector governance

It stands to be the first AI-enabled procurement integrity PPP in Southeast Asia, positioning the Philippines as a regional pioneer.

## 15. Proposed ICC Action

1. Confirm project viability under RA 7718
2. Approve the project for Swiss Challenge
3. Authorize DPWH and the Proponent to proceed with DFS finalization and concession negotiations
4. Allow PPP Center participation as mandated

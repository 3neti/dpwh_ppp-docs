# Legal Basis for the AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)
**Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Proposal for DPWH**

---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the legal foundations supporting the establishment of the AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA) for DPWH through an Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Law, as amended.

The proposed PPP is fully compliant with:
- Republic Act No. 6957 (Build-Operate-Transfer Law)
- Republic Act No. 7718 (Amended BOT Law)
- Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 7718
- Republic Act No. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act)
- COA Circulars on third-party verification, auditing, and document retention
- Data Privacy Act of 2012
- DICT and National Cybersecurity Framework
- PPP Center Guidelines on unsolicited proposals

The IVCA project falls squarely within the legal framework for unsolicited PPPs involving new technology without any government subsidy or guarantee.

## 2. Legal Basis Under RA 7718 (Unsolicited Proposals)

### 2.1 Section 4-A of RA 7718 — Unsolicited Proposals

The law allows unsolicited proposals provided that:
1. The project involves a new concept or technology
2. The proponent possesses a unique capacity to undertake the project
3. No direct government guarantee, subsidy, or equity is required
4. The proposal undergoes a Swiss Challenge

**IVCA Compliance:**

- **New Technology:**  
  AI-enabled procurement verification and automated contract monitoring qualify as a new concept not currently deployed by DPWH or any national agency.

- **Unique Capacity:**  
  The proponent demonstrates proprietary AI models, systems integration, and compliance technology capabilities.

- **No Government Subsidy or Guarantee:**  
  The IVCA is entirely contractor-funded (bidders/winners), hence zero cost to government.

- **Swiss Challenge:**  
  The project will undergo a fully compliant Swiss Challenge process.

## 3. PPP Modalities Under RA 7718 Applicable to IVCA

The IVCA is structured as a:

**Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Variant for Digital Infrastructure**

or

**Build-Operate-Own (BOO) for purely digital systems**

DPWH grants the proponent the right to:
- Build and operate the AI verification system
- Collect fees from private contractors (verification fees)
- Maintain consistency with DPWH technical evaluation workflows
- Turn over systems or continue operations depending on concession structure

No physical civil works are involved — this is a digital infrastructure PPP, which is explicitly allowable under the BOT Law.

---

## 4. Alignment with RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act)

RA 9184 governs DPWH bidding, but third-party technical verification services do not constitute procurement.

Instead, they serve as:
- Integrity mechanisms,
- Compliance layers, and
- Evaluation support tools for the procuring entity.

The IVCA does not replace nor modify the role of:
- BAC
- TWG
- HOPE
- COA
- Resident auditors
- DPWH PMOs

### RA 9184 Compliance Summary

| Function | RA 9184 | IVCA Role |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Bid preparation | Allowed | AI assists in fairness & cost analysis |
| Bid evaluation | BAC/TWG responsibility | IVCA produces analysis; gov't retains decision-making |
| Award | HOPE | No role in award decisions |
| Contract monitoring | PMO/COA | AI enhances verification; gov't retains final approval |
| Payments | DBM/COA | IVCA only validates milestone evidence |

The IVCA functions as a **technical assistive system**, not a procurement authority.

## 5. COA Compliance Framework

The Commission on Audit (COA) allows:
- Third-party validation
- Digital records
- AI-assisted document verification
- Automated monitoring

COA Circulars on:
- Documentary requirements
- Third-party inspection
- Digital proof of completion
- Forensic audit trails

…are fully supported by the IVCA's tamper-evident data logging and audit trail architecture.

**Key COA Compliance Benefits:**
- Full auditability of DPWH procurement
- Clear digital records of all evaluations
- Automated documentation trail
- Faster post-audit and pre-audit verification

The system also assists COA in fraud detection, anomaly detection, and variance analysis.

---

## 6. Data Privacy Act Compliance (RA 10173)

The IVCA operates under strict compliance with RA 10173 through:
- Privacy-by-design architecture
- Data minimization
- Encryption (in transit & at rest)
- Access controls & audit logs
- PCI-DSS–aligned payment flow for contractor fees
- Compliance with the National Privacy Commission (NPC) guidelines
- Third-party data processing contracts (DPA/OPA agreements)

No personal information is disclosed outside DPWH or legally authorized entities.

---

## 7. Cybersecurity & DICT Compliance

The IVCA follows:
- DICT National Cybersecurity Plan
- PNP-ACG interoperability protocols
- NIST and ISO 27001-aligned security frameworks
- Government Cloud-first policy
- Zero-trust architecture
- Multi-layer intrusion detection
- Redundancy & high availability

---

## 8. Fee Collection and Legal Standing

**Legal basis for contractor-funded fees:**

- The BOT Law allows concessionaires to collect user fees, service fees, or verification fees.
- Fee collection from private sector beneficiaries is the standard SGS model, internationally recognized and used in many countries.

**No violation of RA 9184:**

Contractors already pay:
- Bid documents
- Performance bonds
- PhilGEPS fees
- Inspection & testing fees
- Third-party certification costs

The IVCA fee structure is consistent with this legal environment.

---

## 9. Rights of the Proponent

Upon OPS issuance, the proponent gains:
- Right to negotiate concession terms
- Right to match superior offers during Swiss Challenge
- Right to operate the system for the concession period
- Right to collect contractor-funded fees
- Intellectual property protections under the Philippine IP Code

These are standard rights under PPP Center guidelines.

---

## 10. Government Rights & Protections

DPWH retains full authority over:
- Procurement decisions
- Awarding
- Implementation
- Monitoring and evaluation
- Change orders and variation orders
- Approval of concession performance metrics

DPWH also retains:
- Right to audit
- Right to impose penalties
- Right to enforce performance guarantees
- Right to terminate the concession for cause

The IVCA enhances DPWH capabilities without limiting its authority.

---

## 11. Conclusion

The proposed IVCA PPP is fully compliant with the BOT Law, RA 9184, COA Circulars, Data Privacy Act, and DICT cybersecurity standards.

It introduces a legally sound, economically viable, and technologically innovative approach to improving transparency, efficiency, and integrity across DPWH infrastructure procurement and contract implementation—all at zero cost to the government.

The project satisfies all requirements for acceptance as an Unsolicited PPP Proposal, including:
- New technology
- Unique proponent capability
- No government subsidy or guarantee
- Clear value for money
- Public welfare enhancement
- Full compliance with RA 7718's Swiss Challenge provisions

This legal framework firmly establishes the project as a viable, compliant, and advantageous PPP undertaking for the Philippine government.

# AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)
**Contractor-Funded Fee Structure (SGS-Style Model)**

---

## 1. Introduction

This Fee Schedule outlines the proposed fees associated with the Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA) under the PPP concession model.

The model follows well-established international practices used by third-party inspection and verification bodies such as SGS, Bureau Veritas, and TÜV, where the private sector—not the government—bears the cost of assurance and verification.

These fees ensure that the IVCA can operate sustainably, maintain continuous AI model improvements, and deliver reliable, nationwide verification services at zero cost to DPWH.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

The Fee Schedule is based on the following principles:

1. **Zero cost to government** — All fees are borne by bidders or winning contractors.
2. **Fairness and predictability** — Fees are fixed, standardized, and published.
3. **Proportionality** — Larger projects pay proportionally higher verification fees.
4. **Transparency** — All fees are auditable under the concession agreement.
5. **Non-discrimination** — All contractors are subject to the same fee structure, regardless of region.
6. **Value for money** — Fees correspond to AI-enabled verification services that reduce project risk and improve delivery outcomes.

## 3. Fee Categories

The IVCA fee structure consists of four main categories:

1. **Bid Document Compliance Review Fee** (optional, pre-bid)
2. **Bid Tender AI Evaluation Fee** (all bidders)
3. **Winner Verification Fee** (before Notice to Proceed)
4. **AI Contract Monitoring & Milestone Validation Fee** (optional add-on)

Each fee category is detailed below.

## 4. Bid Document Compliance Review Fee (Optional)

This service is requested by DPWH PMOs or Regional Offices to ensure that bid documents (TOR, BOQ, Technical Specs, etc.) are:
- Free from discriminatory or restrictive provisions
- Complete and compliant with RA 9184
- Supported by reasonable and updated cost assumptions
- Aligned with historical price benchmarks

**Flat Rate:**

**₱10,000 per bid package**

This is an optional service and may be requested only during bid preparation.

## 5. Bid Tender AI Evaluation Fee (Mandatory for All Bidders)

This fee covers IVCA's automated and human-assisted evaluation of bid submissions, including:

✔ Eligibility validation

## 6. Winner Verification Fee

This fee is collected only from the winning bidder before Notice to Proceed (NTP).

It funds the final cross-verification of:
- Contract alignment

The fee is tiered based on the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC).

| ₱50M – ₱100M | ₱50,000 |
| ₱100M – ₱500M | ₱120,000 |
| Above ₱500 Million | 0.025% of ABC |

**Rationale for the Tiered Model:**
- Keeps fees affordable for small contractors
- Aligns cost with project complexity

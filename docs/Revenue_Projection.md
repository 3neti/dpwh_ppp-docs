## 2. Revenue Stream Analysis

### 2.1 Bid Tender AI Evaluation Fee (Mandatory)

**Fee Structure:** ₱5,000 per bidder per project

**Calculation:**

**Rationale:**
- Covers AI-powered evaluation services for all bidders
- Ensures integrity of the bidding process
- Affordable entry cost for contractors

**Risk:** Lower optional services adoption

**Mitigation:**
- Mandatory fees alone generate ₱1.37B (77% of total)
- Optional services provide upside potential
- Demonstrated value proposition encourages adoption

### 6.3 Competitive Risk

**Risk:** Competitors offering similar services

**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage through OPS
- Swiss Challenge right-to-match provision
- Proprietary AI models and DPWH integration

## Appendix A: Calculation Methodology

### A.1 Bidder Calculation

```
Total Bidders = Projects × Average Bidders per Project
70,000 = 20,000 × 3.5
```

### A.2 Winner Verification Revenue

```
Category Revenue = Number of Projects × Fee per Winner
Example: Small Projects = 12,000 × ₱30,000 = ₱360,000,000
```

### A.3 Growth Projection

```
Year N Revenue = Year (N-1) Revenue × (1 + Growth Rate)
Year 2 = ₱1,778M × 1.05 = ₱1,867M
```

### A.4 Operating Margin

```
Operating Margin = (Revenue - Operating Costs) / Revenue
52.2% = (₱1,778M - ₱850M) / ₱1,778M
```

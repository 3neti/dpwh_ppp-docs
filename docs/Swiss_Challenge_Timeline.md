# AI-Powered Independent Verification & Compliance Auditor (IVCA)
**Unsolicited Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Proposal**  
**Swiss Challenge Workflow & Detailed Timeline**

---

## 1. Overview

The Swiss Challenge is the mandatory competitive process applied to unsolicited PPP proposals under RA 6957 as amended by RA 7718 (BOT Law).

It ensures that the Original Proponent's (OP) proposal is tested against market competition through a transparent and structured procedure.

This document presents a realistic, DPWH-aligned Swiss Challenge timeline for the proposed IVCA PPP Project, a nationwide AI-enabled verification and compliance auditing system.

---

## 2. Key Milestones in the Swiss Challenge Process

The Swiss Challenge has six major phases:

1. **Submission of Unsolicited Proposal**
2. **Initial Evaluation & OPS Issuance**
3. **Detailed Negotiations & Feasibility Study**
4. **NEDA ICC Evaluation & Approval**
5. **Swiss Challenge (Competitive Challenge Period)**
6. **Awarding, Contract Finalization, & Implementation**

Each phase is detailed below with timeline estimates.

## 3. Detailed Swiss Challenge Timeline

The timeline below assumes a streamlined PPP processing framework, typical for national agencies such as DPWH and consistent with PPP Center guidelines.

---

### Phase 1 — Submission of Unsolicited Proposal

**Timeline: Day 0**

The proponent submits:
- Concept Note
- Executive Brief
- Feasibility Study Outline
- Preliminary Financial Model
- Legal Basis under RA 7718
- Proposed Concession Structure
- Draft Concession Agreement
- Risk Allocation Framework
- Proposed Fee Schedule

**Outcome:**  
DPWH formally receives the unsolicited proposal for evaluation.

---

### Phase 2 — Initial Evaluation & OPS Issuance

**Timeline: Day 0 to Day 90**

DPWH conducts initial assessment to determine:
- Technical feasibility
- Legal viability under RA 7718
- Financial sustainability
- Alignment with DPWH mandate
- Compliance with PPP Center rules
- No government subsidy, guarantee, or budgetary requirement

If found meritorious, DPWH issues:

**Original Proponent Status (OPS)**

— granting the proponent the right to match competing proposals during the Swiss Challenge.

**Outcome:**  
Project is officially declared feasible in principle.

---

### Phase 3 — Detailed Negotiations & Feasibility Study

**Timeline: Day 90 to Day 180**

DPWH + Proponent conduct:
- Joint Detailed Feasibility Study (DFS)
- Comprehensive risk analysis
- Economic & financial viability studies
- Environmental & social assessment (if applicable)
- Finalized fee schedule
- Detailed AI technical architecture
- Governance & compliance protocols
- Institutional arrangement model

Outputs include:
1. Final DFS
2. Revised Concession Terms
3. Final Draft Concession Agreement
4. PPP Center Review Package

**Outcome:**  
DPWH endorses the project for NEDA ICC approval.

---

### Phase 4 — NEDA ICC Evaluation & Approval

**Timeline: Day 180 to Day 300**

Two stages:

**Stage 1 — ICC Technical Board (ICC-TB)**

Reviews technical soundness, financial structure, and alignment with national priorities.

**Stage 2 — ICC Cabinet Committee (ICC-CC)**

Grants the final approval for the PPP project.

**Expected Processing Time:**  
60–120 days depending on ICC calendar.

**Outcome:**  
NEDA ICC approved project is ready for the Swiss Challenge phase.

---

### Phase 5 — Swiss Challenge (Competitive Challenge Process)

**Timeline: Day 300 to Day 360**

DPWH publishes:
- Call for comparative proposals
- Approved DFS
- Concession Terms
- Instructions to Challengers
- Submission Schedule

**60-Day Challenge Period**

Interested challengers may submit competing proposals.

DPWH evaluates competing bids under the same criteria:
- Technical capability
- Concession terms
- Financial plan
- Risk allocation

**Right-to-Match**

If a challenger submits a superior proposal, the Original Proponent has the right to match within a defined period (typically 30 days).

**Outcome:**  
If matched, the Original Proponent is awarded the project.

---

### Phase 6 — Awarding, Contract Finalization & Implementation

**Timeline: Day 360 to Day 420**

Steps:
1. Issuance of Notice of Award
2. Signing of the Concession Agreement
3. Financial closing (if required)
4. Establishment of the Project Management Office (PMO)
5. Technology deployment & onboarding
6. Rollout to DPWH Central & Regional Offices

**Outcome:**  
Full project mobilization begins within 30 days of signing.

---

## 4. Consolidated Timeline Summary

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Milestone |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| 1. Submission | Day 0 | Unsolicited proposal filed |
| 2. OPS Evaluation | 0–90 days | OPS issued |
| 3. DFS + Negotiation | 90–180 days | DFS & concessions finalized |
| 4. NEDA ICC Approval | 180–300 days | ICC-CC approval |
| 5. Swiss Challenge | 300–360 days | Competitive challenge completed |
| 6. Award & Signing | 360–420 days | Contract signed & implementation begins |

**Total Estimated Duration:**  
~420 days (14 months) from submission to full rollout.

---

## 5. Key Advantages of the Proposed Timeline

### Predictable

The timeline aligns with historical PPP durations and PPP Center guidelines.

### Efficient

The IVCA project requires no land acquisition, civil works, or environmental permitting — allowing a faster processing timeline.

### Low Regulatory Complexity

As a technology + compliance project, it bypasses the lengthy project readiness requirements typical of civil infrastructure PPPs.

### Zero Fiscal Impact

The Swiss Challenge proceeds smoothly since the project requires no government budget.

---

## 6. Conclusion

This Swiss Challenge timeline ensures:
- Transparency
- Competition
- Accountability
- Alignment with RA 7718
- Predictable processing for both DPWH and the proponent

Upon completion of this process, DPWH will be positioned to deploy the first national-scale AI procurement integrity system in Southeast Asia, significantly enhancing infrastructure governance and public trust.
